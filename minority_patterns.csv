"Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring. A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to be studios and disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student. The materials or links provided for study purpose is good, clarity in depth of courses but again it differs from teacher to teacher. The evaluation is again bad for our CA, as one of our faculty is really weird. He gives us remarks on the basis of how we present things in front of it, he never look for the content of our answer, which is really annoying. As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do. But how can a person do that, as people do have different mentality and they do explain themselves in different manner, so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the basis of what they say not what they should say. This is really a good thing that events happen in our university regularly but they must be announced early so that every student can prepare themselves for participation because sometimes we get to know about most of the events when they have already been conducted. So announcement must be there.",Negative,True,False,-1
